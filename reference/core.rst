.. currentmodule:: nipy.core

The core package contains two major components.  The first component is
:mod:`.reference` - the definition of spaces and coordinate systems
that define the locations of images in space.  The second is
:mod:`.image` defining the nipy image object, and code that works on
the image object.  There are some supporting routines in
the :mod:`.utils` package.
